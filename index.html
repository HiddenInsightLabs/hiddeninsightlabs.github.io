    <h1>Careful testing for augmented reality and immersive systems</h1>
    <p>
      Hidden Insight Labs is an independent testing practice focused on identifying
      real-world risks in AR, spatial, and emerging interactive technologies before
      they reach users.

    <h3>What testing reveals</h3>
    <p class="statement">
      Across immersive projects, the most significant risks are rarely visual fidelity.
      They emerge from interaction breakdowns, environmental constraints, and mismatches
      between system behavior and user expectations.

    <h3>How early testing reduces risk</h3>
    <p class="statement">
      AR systems fail in predictable stages. Starting testing early allows teams to
      remove the most damaging issues first, then progressively refine the experience.

    <h3>Our perspective</h3>
    <p class="statement">
      Immersive systems behave differently outside controlled environments.
      Lighting, space, movement, hardware limitations, and user expectations
      all introduce failure modes that are easy to miss during development.
